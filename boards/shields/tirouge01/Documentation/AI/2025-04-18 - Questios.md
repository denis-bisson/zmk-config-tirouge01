# Questions to Copilot/Gemini about character frequencies

## 1. '/' & '\' versus '=' & '+'
*I have question about the frequency of typing character pairs "/" and "\" versus the pair "=" and "+".  
Assuming I am a French Canadian...
Assuming half of my time I am writing French and English message and text.  
Assuming the other half of my time I am programing in Delphi, C, C++ and Python.  
According to you, if we cumulate the total combined number of "/" and "\" I hit on the keyboard versus the one of "=" and "+", which combinaison is higher?  
Please, do not response with thing like "It depends of this and this...".  
Please, answer ONE or the OTHER and justify why you chose that for me.*

### Copilot answer
Based on your provided assumptions, I would say the **combined frequency of "/" and "\\" is higher** than "=" and "+".

Here's why:
1. **Programming Usage**:
   - Languages like **C, C++, Python, and Delphi** rely heavily on `/` (e.g., for division or comments) and `\` (e.g., in escape sequences or file paths on Windows).
   - Comparatively, `=` is crucial but tends to pair with `==` for equality or `=` for assignments. The `+` operator is less frequent in many contexts, as it mostly appears for arithmetic or string concatenation. Together, they occur less often than `/` and `\`.

2. **French and English Text**:
   - When writing text, `/` is used in dates (e.g., 18/04/2025), abbreviations (e.g., "and/or"), and URLs. The `\` character is uncommon in non-technical writing.
   - In contrast, `=` and `+` are rarely used in standard text unless you're specifically writing formulas or technical documents.

3. **File Paths**:
   - For a developer working in a Windows environment, file paths (e.g., `C:\Program Files`) make the backslash (`\`) an unavoidable keystroke.
   - Meanwhile, the `=` and `+` keys are less frequent, even when coding.

**Conclusion**  
Given your mixed activities of **general text writing and programming**, `/` and `\` come out on top in cumulative usage. This conclusion is shaped by the high dependency on these characters in coding across multiple languages and technical writing contexts.

### Gemini answer
Based on your usage as a French Canadian writing in both French and English, and programming in Delphi, C, C++, and Python, I would say you likely hit the **"/" and "\" combination more frequently** than the "=" and "+" combination.

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Programming:** The forward slash "/" is heavily used in programming for file paths, comments (in C++, Python, and sometimes C), and division operations. The backslash "\" is also used for file paths (though less common in modern systems and Python), escape sequences in strings across multiple languages, and line continuation in Python. While "=" is fundamental for assignments, and "+" for addition, the sheer number of times you might refer to file locations or write comments across your programming activities would likely lead to a higher frequency of "/" and "\".

2. **Writing (French and English):** Neither "/" nor "\" are standard punctuation marks in French or English prose. While they might occasionally appear in specific contexts (like fractions or informal notes), their usage is far less frequent than "=" (used in equations or comparisons) and "+" (used for addition or in contexts like "and/or" although "/" is more common there). However, the *cumulative* use in programming is likely to outweigh the less frequent use in writing.

**Conclusion**  
Therefore, considering the significant use of "/" and "\" in multiple programming languages for various purposes, I lean towards that combination being typed more often overall.

5.  `=` and `+`

## 5. Frequency of "é", "è", "à" and "ç"
*In French language, please sort the frequency of occurance of the following letters when writing in French: é à è ç  
I am not talking about scanning all the words of dictionary and do stats on that.  
No. I am talking about daily life when writing email.  
In this context some words are used much more often than others and so the hit frequency of a letters will increase no matter the number of words in the dictionary.  
Do not answer "It depends of...".  
Choose your camp!  
And justify a little if you want.*

### Copilot answer
In the context of daily life and writing emails in French, here's the ranking of these letters in terms of frequency:

1. **é**  
2. **à**  
3. **è**  
4. **ç**

### Brief Justification:
- **é** is overwhelmingly common due to its presence in frequently used words like "été," "réponse," "déjà," "état," and more. It's an essential part of conjugations and nouns in everyday French writing.
- **à** appears regularly in emails because it's used as a preposition (e.g., "à la maison," "à vous," "à bientôt"). Prepositions are naturally frequent in communication.
- **è** is less frequent but still appears in common words such as "très," "père," "mère," and "près." While important, it's overshadowed by **é** and **à**.
- **ç** is the least frequent since its usage is limited to specific words like "ça," "façon," "garçon," and "français." It doesn't have as broad a presence as the others.

Let me know if you'd like insights on other letters!

### Gemini answer
Okay, switching to English!

Considering daily email writing for a French speaker in Quebec, I would rank the frequency of these letters from most to least common as follows:

1.  **é**
2.  **à**
3.  **è**
4.  **ç**

**Brief Justification:**

* **é:** Appears very often in past participles and certain adjectives (e.g., *terminé, allé, organisé*), as well as common words (e.g., *été, café, préféré*).
* **à:** A very frequent word as a preposition (e.g., *aller à, parler à*) and also the third-person singular of the verb *avoir* (e.g., *il a*).
* **è:** Less frequent than *é* and *à*, but present in some verbs (e.g., *il est, très*), adverbs, and nouns (e.g., *accès, après*).
* **ç:** Primarily used before the vowels *a*, *o*, and *u* to give the *c* a soft sound (e.g., *ça, garçon, reçu*). Its usage is more limited compared to the other accented letters.

While the exact frequency can fluctuate based on the email's topic, in typical daily communication, I believe this order provides a reasonable representation.

## 6. Frequency of "é", "è", "à", "ç", "ê", "î", "ô", "û", "è", "ë", "ï" and "ù"

*And let's suppose we are adding in the mix the following letters: ê î ô û è ë ï ù

## 9. Usage of the "F" keys and their combinaison

### Question
Assuming we are in Windows, I know there are the function keys F1 to F12.
I know some applications use them for shortcut for action.
We may use them also in combinaison with CTRL+Fx, ALT+Fx, SHIFT+Fx, etc.
We may also use them in combinaison with two others like CTRL+SHIFT+Fx, etc.
Maybe in combinaison with Wind Keys, etc.
Could you make a mark down table of all the combinaison of CTRL/SHIFT/ALT/WIN key used with any function keys F1-F12 with according to you the percentage of usage? Let's assume we are talking about a power user using many Windows application, many compilers, many editor like VS Code, etc.
Do no tell me it depends on this, this or this.
I know.
Choose your camp!
You can evaluate this way more than me!
