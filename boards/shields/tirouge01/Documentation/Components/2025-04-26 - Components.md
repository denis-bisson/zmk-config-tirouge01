### Linear Switches
Linear switches have a linear curve: when pressing down the switch, there are no bumps or variances in force required to press it further.

### Tactile Switches
Tactile switches have a bump in their curve: around their actuation point, you'll feel a difference in force so you can feel when a switch has actuated.

| Color   | Style        | Pression | Notes                                                      |
|-        |-             |-         |-                                                           |

### Clicky Switches
Like tactile switches, these have a bump in their curve. Next to that, they make a distinct clicky sound, so the feedback is also audible. Of the switches below, the Jade and Navy switches are loudest, the Robin and Pale Blue noticeable, and the White is relatively subtle.

| Color   | Style        | Pression | Notes                                                      |
|-        |-             |-         |-                                                           |
| Clicky  | White        | 50gf     |                                                            |
| Clicky  | Jade         | 50gf     | thicker clickbar than White                                |
| Clicky  | Robin        | 60gf     | gold plated springs                                        |
| Clicky  | Navy         | 60gf     | thicker clickbar                                           |
| Clicky  | Pale Blue    | 70gf     |                                                            |
