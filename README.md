# Guidelines for my goals I wish to achieved with my keyboard layout and configuration.
## I'll try to refer to them when making a decision on something.

- Use ENGRAM layout.
- Support English 1st.
- Support all French letters with accents and their capitalization.
- Support common Spanish letters for some colleagues like the "√≠", "√∫", "√±", etc.
- Have all the accentuated letters always on left side.
- Have the most common accent of a character on the normal key for it. Like "√†" on "a", "√©" on "e", "√ß" on "c", "√±" on "n". 

- No contorsionist.
- No more than two keys to type anything, except the typical keyboard shortcut like CLTR+ALT+F1, WIN+SHIFT+S, etc.
- No dead keys. If I want to do a √ç character, do it with a layer, not contorsionist.
- No tap dance for anything common. Except for maybe rare used accent like "ƒù", "≈õ", etc.

- In the .keymap file, do not have lines with more than 170 characters. I like to view all on a line.
- Because of the above point, have the beahovior and macro names not too long.

- Have ALL the hold-tap and layer-tap symetrical on both side.
- Have numbers on right.
- Have function keys on right.
- Have cursor movement on right.

- Put most used and common stuff of most agile fingers.
- Here is the order from the most agile to the less agile:
  - Index
  - Middle
  - Index second column
  - Pinky
  - Ring
